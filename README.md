# C

My journey mastering low-level C.

This repository documents everything I learn in C through hands-on practice. Each file demonstrates a specific concept, feature, or system-level behavior in isolation.

## Structure

Each folder contains C files grouped by topic:

.
├── arrays/
├── pointers/
├── function_pointers/
├── strings/
├── memory/
└── ...

Goal
Master the C programming language from the ground up — with full understanding of what the machine is doing.

No libraries. No shortcuts. Just pure C.
